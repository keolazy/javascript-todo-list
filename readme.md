#Todo List

make index.html
make todos.css
link stylesheet



Create a todo list app using HTML, JS, and the CSS file `todos.css` in this directory.  Your app should look and function like the following GIF:

### Part One

* A user can hit enter in the text input to add a new todo
* A user can click on the "Add Todo" button to add a new todo
* Make sure the app looks just like the following gif.  Use the CSS to figure out what element types, classnames, and id's you may need to use.

### Part Two

* When a user clicks on an 'X' on a todo, it removes that todo item.
* When a user clicks on 'Edit' on a todo, it lets the user edit the todo item
